#Methods tp ensure good result
I tried to use different methods to avoid any mistakes by the user such as if someone uses an email which is already taken by some another user then in that case the apology cat will shows up with the problem ans tell the user to change thier email. As same as that i used many if else statements to ensure that none of the user fill half information or try to makethe system down.
